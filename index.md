### Introduction

The objective of this project was to analyze the historical evolution of priorities and perceived problems of the American public. Specifically we wanted to answer the question of _Can the language and content of proposed amendments reveal the century in which they were proposed?_ Answering this question is important because it will reveal how the issues Americans deemed critical have evolved and how historical context shapes our political and legal discourse.
